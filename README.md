# Aadhar-Enrollment-app

### I have design an Aadhar Enrollment Application where a user can login and get his aadhar number. 

# Features:-
1. Admin can generate a new aadhar card by entering information of the user.
2. The aadhar card number will be auto generated by the system from the backend side of the system.
3. The user can login-in by the username as the email id provided at the time of registration and the password.

# Technologies that we used :-
1. REACT
2. CSS
3. Node.js
4. Express.js
5. MongoDB
